# rustymind
Rustymind is a driver and parser for NeuroSky MindWave EGG headset written in pure Rust. You can use it to connect, interact, and plot real time data from the headset.

This library is based on the [mindwave mindset communication protocols](./docs) published by Neurosky.

See below for a screenshot of real time mindwave plots provided by `rustymind-plot` CLI.
